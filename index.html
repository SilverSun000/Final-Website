            <h2>Virtual Reality</h2>
            <p>
                <br>
                Virtual Reality has become a tool for imaginging and creating
                worlds, as well as becoming a platform
                for new ideas. It allows us to visualize complex systems like 
                cities, stadiums, and electrical grids, or even take a journey 
                inside the human body to better understand how it functions. 
                Virtually any concept can be brought to life and explored in 
                immersive, virtual environments. Today, I’ll be guiding you 
                through these exciting technologies and showing you how 
                they’re shaping the future.

                As VR continues to advance, its applications extend far beyond 
                entertainment. In fields like medicine, education, architecture, 
                and engineering, it's becoming an indispensable tool for both 
                learning and innovation. Whether it’s training doctors through 
                simulated surgeries, allowing students to explore historical 
                events firsthand, or helping architects design buildings by 
                immersing themselves in 3D models, virtual reality is opening 
                up new possibilities for how we interact with and understand 
                the world. The potential is limitless, and the boundaries of 
                what can be achieved are expanding every day.
